# NGRX Hateoas

A library to bring hypermedia json into the ngrx signal store following the HATEOAS approach to make it easily useable within Angular.

## Repo Usage

The repository provides the library itself, a playground app and a dummy backend which provides some Hypermedia Web APIs.``

To run the playground app clone the repository and run an `npm install`. Then start the backend with `npm run server` and the playground app with `npm start`.

## Sample Application
There is a sample application [Fancy.ResourceLinker.Sample](https://github.com/fancyDevelopment/Fancy.ResourceLinker.Sample) which demonstrates end to end real world usage of hypermedia in Angular and also some other aspects of a real wold system.
