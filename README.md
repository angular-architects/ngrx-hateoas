# NGRX Hateoas

A library to bring hypermedia json into the ngrx signal store following the HATEOAS approach to make it easily useable within Angular.

## Repo Usage

The repository provides the library itself, a playground app and a dummy backend which provides some Hypermedia Web APIs.``

To run the playground app clone the repository and run an `npm install`. Then start the backend with `npm run server` and the playground app with `npm start`.

## Playground applicaiton

Use and review the playground application inside the repository to understand how to use the library. Also you can review the http responses and requests in the browser network tab to get an impression of how hypermedia json can look like. 

## Documentation
Will be done soon - I promise!

## Real World Sample Application
There is a sample application [Fancy.ResourceLinker.Sample](https://github.com/fancyDevelopment/Fancy.ResourceLinker.Sample) which demonstrates end to end real world usage of hypermedia in Angular and also some other aspects of a real wold system.
